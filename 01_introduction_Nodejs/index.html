      <h2>Introduction to Node.js</h2>
      <p>
        Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime
        environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
      </p>
      <p>
        Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome,
        outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread
        for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives
        in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and
        generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking
        paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network,
        accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread
        and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when
        the response comes back.
      </p>
      <p>
        This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a
        single server without introducing the burden of managing thread
        concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers
        that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the
        server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to
        learn a completely different language.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as
        you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you
        are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing
        the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental
        features by running Node.js with flags.
